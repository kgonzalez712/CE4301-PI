EARLY IN THE MORNING, RISIN TO THE STREET LIGHT ME UP THAT CIGARETTE AND I STRAP SHOES ON MY FEET GOT TO FIND A REASON, A REASON THINGS WENT WRONG GOT TO FIND A REASON WHY MY MONEYS ALL GONE I GOT A DALMATIAN, AND I CAN STILL GET HIGH I CAN PLAY THE GUITAR LIKE A MOTHER FUCKING RIOT
WELL, LIFE IS TOO SHORT, SO LOVE THE ONE YOU GOT CAUSE YOU MIGHT GET RUN OVER OR YOU MIGHT GET SHOT NEVER START NO STATIC I JUST GET IT OFF MY CHEST NEVER HAD TO BATTLE WITH NO BULLETPROOF VEST TAKE A SMALL EXAMPLE
